## Project Description
This project includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in the dataset.
- Development of machine learning models to predict churn.
- A Flask API for serving predictions.
- A Streamlit application for an interactive user interface.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for EDA)

## Data Exploration
- Conducted EDA to analyze customer data.
- Visualized churn rates and correlated features.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for model training.

## Model Development
- Implemented various machine learning algorithms, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Flask API Endpoint
- Developed a Flask API to expose the churn prediction model.
- Endpoints allow users to submit customer data and receive churn predictions.

## Streamlit Application
- Created a user-friendly Streamlit application to visualize results and make predictions.
- Users can input customer features and get immediate feedback on churn likelihood.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telephone-churn-prediction.git
   cd telephone-churn-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
### Running the Flask API
To run the Flask API, use:
```bash
python app.py
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Running the Streamlit Application
To start the Streamlit application, use:
```bash
streamlit run app_streamlit.py
```
The app will open in your default web browser.
